# Data Visualization using Power_BI:

# Project 1: Creating a data model for Seven Sages Brewing Company (SSBC):

In this project, we'll create a data model and Power BI report for Seven Sages Brewing Company that combines information from all over the company. Our data model will make it possible for the company's CFO to quickly review and analyze what beers sell well and which ones generate the highest profitability.

# Steps follows the following diagram:

# Steps:
1. Familiarize with Source Files: Download and understand the provided source files from SSBC.
2. Design Data Model: Create a visual representation (sketch) of how the data will be structured and related.
3. Load Data into Power BI: Use "Get Data" feature in Power BI to import data from the starter materials.
4. Clean and Organize Data: Structure, combine, and clean the data to ensure it's in a usable format for analysis.
5. Establish Date Table: Create a dedicated date table to support time-related analysis and functions.
6. Establish Relationships: Link various tables by creating relationships, connecting dimensions to relevant keys in the fact table.
7. Create Required Measures: Develop six measures (formulas) for calculating Sales, Cost of Sales, and Gross Profit Margin in two different currencies as needed.
8. Develop Visual Reports: Build a basic visual report using Power BI to present and interpret the analyzed data.

# Project 2: Building a Power BI report for Waggle:

Dataset : A startup that makes smart devices for pets.Recently, Waggle has been thrilled by the success of their new Lapdog device, a fitness collar that lets owners track their dog’s steps, alerts them when it’s time for a walk, and even repels fleas! Our task for creating the Power BI report that tells the story of how the Lapcat data compares to findings from the dog collar Lapdog devices.

## Output :

# Project 3: MARKET ANALYSIS FOR RETAIL CLOTHING COMPANY

### This project is intended to draw the necessary conclusions for the business.  

- We had five important questions to inquire about; the following are the responses to each of them. 

## Analysis Questions: 

 1. What is the correlation (R2 value) between sales and income? 

- The correlation coefficient between Sales and Income is 0.78.  

- The chart below displays the scatterplot illustrating the linear regression relationship between the variables, along with the associated card showing the calculated R^2 value and formulas related to calculated sales and income.

2. What is the correlation (R2 value) between customer ratings and product return rate? 

The correlation coefficient between Customer Ratings and product return rate is 0.69, indicating that higher customer ratings correlate with a lower return rate for products. The chart below illustrates the scatterplot depicting the linear regression between the variables, along with the accompanying card showing the calculated R2 value. 

 <img width="950" alt="image" src="https://github.com/sunandhini96/Power_BI_Projects_Udacity/assets/63030539/668b3153-9072-4ddb-9b84-6161a084ebc6">


3. What are the linear regression formulas to predict customer income from customer sales? 

- The linear regression equations are as follows: 
- To predict customer sales, the formula utilized is y = 0.0107x - 722.14.
- To predict customer incomes,the formula employed is x = (-722.14 – y) / -0.0107. 

4. Which customer do you predict has the highest income? 

The individual with the highest predicted income is Jon Little, residing in Illinois, born on June 3, 1984. Over the last 6 months, he made purchases totaling $5250, and his predicted income stands at $558143.9252. 

We advise offering him the leather bag. 


5. Which product will be advertised the most? 

- The sweater priced at $100 as the most promoted product, based on the forecasted income and sales for each customer. 

- It will be suggested to 660 customers, constituting 66% of the overall total.

## Some more data visualizations for better understanding: 

- Highest sales for the chronograph watch, being the product with best customer rating, and also the lowest return rate. 

- According to its $350 price and stock of 65 units, it has potential to made $22,750 sales. 

- Lowest sales for winter gloves, being the product with lowest rating and highest return rate. 

- According to its $75 price and stocks of 171 units, it has potential to made $12,825 sales.
